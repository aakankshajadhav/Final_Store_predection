# Store Sales Prediction

Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in
order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data
warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and
particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more
anomalies and common patterns can be discovered.
So, We have build a solution which is able to predict the sales of the
different stores of Big Mart according to the provided dataset.


We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output
variable(s). We need to predict the sales for test data set.

Item_Identifier: Unique product ID

Item_Weight: Weight of product

Item_Fat_Content: Whether the product is low fat or not

Item_Visibility: The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the
particular product

Item_Type: The category to which the product belongs

Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product

Outlet_Identifier: Unique store ID

Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year in which store was established

Outlet_Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered

Outlet_Location_Type: The type of city in which the store is located

Outlet_Type: Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket

Item_Outlet_Sales: Sales of the product in the particulat store. This is the outcome
variable to be predicted.
